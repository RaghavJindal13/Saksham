# Saksham
A Learning Management System for the schools adopted by UPES CSR

# Problem Statement
The COVID 19 pandemic has affected all the sectors around the globe. Due to disruption in
the education sector the adopted schools of UPES CSR are finding it difficult to manage
effective education so the LMS is required for enhancing the quality of teaching and
learning.

Our motive is to maintain the easiest user accessibility in our LMS system and engage our
learners in the learning process in the most manageable way with timing flexibilities provided
and promoting the two way communication between teachers and students.
